Visual Studio solution with C++ 17

## Getting started

To work with the string class, you just need to insert `String.h` and `String.cpp` from `src` folder into your own project solution and include the `String.h` file in your .h or .cpp files.

For example:

```C++
#include "src/String.h"

String str = "Hello World";
```

## Tests

Run the `Test.cpp` in test folder.
